# WhispWaypoints

A banner-based waypoint system for Minecraft Paper 1.21+ servers. Players can create, activate, and teleport to custom waypoints using banners and a token-based activation system.

Originally developed for the Hololive Construction Minecraft server by Derek Lee (@dlee13), updated for Paper 1.21+ by wolftailvale and renamed to WhispWaypoints.

## Features

- **Banner-based waypoints**: Create waypoints by placing named banners
- **Token activation system**: Collaborative waypoint activation using craftable tokens
- **Teleportation with delays**: Configurable teleport delays with progress bars
- **Charge system**: Teleports consume charges that regenerate over time
- **Home & camp locations**: Set personal teleport points
- **Visual holograms**: Floating text displays above waypoints
- **Chunk-based storage**: One waypoint per chunk with persistent data
- **Staff management tools**: Admin commands for waypoint management, banner replacement, and repositioning

## Installation

1. Download the latest release JAR file
2. Place `WhispWaypoints-x.x.x.jar` in your server's `plugins/` folder
3. Download and install [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) (required dependency)
4. Restart your server
5. Configure `plugins/WhispWaypoints/config.yml` as needed

## Usage

### Creating Waypoints

1. **Enter create mode**: `/waypoints create`
2. **Place a banner** on top of any block (within 30 seconds)
   - Banner must be in an allowed world (see config)
   - Chunk must not already contain a waypoint
   - Rename the banner in an anvil first to set the waypoint name

### Activating Waypoints

Newly created waypoints start inactive and need tokens to activate:

1. **Craft tokens**: 8 Echo Shards surrounding 1 Ender Pearl
2. **Enter token mode**: `/waypoints addtoken`  
3. **Right-click the waypoint** to contribute a token
4. **Repeat** until enough tokens are contributed (default: 8 tokens required)
5. Waypoint automatically activates when threshold is reached

### Using Waypoints

1. **Register**: Right-click any active waypoint to add it to your personal list
2. **Teleport**: 
   - Open GUI: `/waypoints`
   - Direct command: `/waypoints teleport <name>`
3. **Set locations**:
   - Home: `/waypoints sethome` then right-click a location
   - Camp: `/setcamp` (automatically places banner at your current location)

### Camp Shortcuts

Quick commands for camp management:

- `/setcamp` - Automatically places a white banner at your location with your name and sets it as your camp
- `/camp` - Teleport to your camp (same as `/waypoints teleport camp`) 
- `/unsetcamp` - Removes your camp location and the camp banner

**Camp Features:**
- **Automatic banner placement**: `/setcamp` places a white banner with "[PlayerName]'s Camp" 
- **Smart positioning**: Banner is placed on the ground or at your location if suitable
- **Hologram display**: Shows camp name above the banner (visible to you)
- **Auto-cleanup**: `/unsetcamp` removes both the banner and hologram
- **Replaces existing**: Setting a new camp removes any previous camp banner

### Staff Commands

Players with `waypoints.staff` permission (ops by default):

- `/editwaypoints activate` - Instantly activate any waypoint
- `/editwaypoints delete` - Remove waypoints and refund tokens
- `/editwaypoints menu` - Open staff management GUI
- `/editwaypoints replacebanner` - Replace waypoint banners while preserving waypoint data
- `/editwaypoints reposition` - Move waypoints to new locations

#### Staff Management Details

**Banner Replacement Mode** (`/editwaypoints replacebanner`):
- Enter replacement mode for 30 seconds
- Hold the new banner type in your hand
- Right-click any waypoint banner to swap it
- Preserves waypoint name, activation status, and contributors
- Automatically faces the banner toward you

**Waypoint Repositioning Mode** (`/editwaypoints reposition`):
- Enter reposition mode for 30 seconds
- Crouch + right-click with empty hand on waypoint banner to pick it up
- Right-click any solid block to place the waypoint at new location
- Preserves all waypoint data, banner patterns, and activation status
- Validates distance from other waypoints and world restrictions
- Automatically restores waypoint if mode expires while holding one

### Console Commands

- `/waypoints backup` - Create backup ZIP file
- `/waypoints save` - Force save data to disk
- `/waypoints load` - Reload data from disk
- `/waypoints reload` - Reload configuration

## Configuration

  teleport-waypoint-cost: 1      # Charges for waypoint teleport
  regenerate-time: 24000         # Ticks between charge regeneration (20 min)

token:
  capacity: 1                    # Maximum tokens per player
  activate-waypoint-cost: 8      # Tokens needed to activate waypoint

teleport:
  wait-time: 140                 # Teleport delay in ticks (7 seconds)

world:
  home: [world]                  # Worlds where homes can be set
  camp: [world_nether, world_the_end]  # Worlds where camps can be set
